## Principals

This repo demostrates best practices of `Good Software Development` by following these principals:

- All build steps are wrapped in a common interface `Make`
- Build steps executed as basic shell/API calls in some cases, but in most cases execution is via docker images
- A single commit results in one artifact (which is immutable)

## What this repo does

This hello world app (written in Golang) demonstrates the following features:

- Building an application (`make build`)
- Running an application locally (`make run` then open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser)
- Testing an application (`make test`)
- Storing properties associated with an application artifact (`make create_table` && `make create_tags`)

**note:** some actions expect an `aws.env` file to communicate with AWS infrastructure for the purposes of the demo. See `Makefile` for more information.

## Pipeline

Github actions is used to demonstrate a best practice pipeline: [Hello World Pipeline](https://github.com/contino/gsd-hello-world/actions).

This includes the creation of artifacts ("packages") for each commit: [Hello World Packages](https://github.com/contino/gsd-hello-world/packages).

# More Info

## Requirements

### Desktop / Workstation Setup

You'll need `make`, `docker`, and `docker-compose` on your workstation.

On a Mac this should do:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew cask install docker
```

For Windows machines, `make` can be installed a number of ways, ie directly, via Chocolatey, or via WSL.

### Other

You will require the following environment variables in your shell (or in the case of a build server like Github Actions, in your Settings/Secrets section).

`SONAR_TOKEN` is used to allow sonar scanning.

`GH_PACKAGES` is used to upload to Github Packages.

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` are used for access to AWS to manage data in DynamoDB.

## Artifact Storage

**AWS DynamoDB** was used to keep the demo as simple and self-contained as possible, with the view than it would be replaced by an actual artifact store for a real impelmentation. For this reason the demo requires AWS credentials for some actions.

This demo wraps it's DynamoDB calls with `make` via `make create_table` and `make create_tags` targets to prove implementation is viable.

Other Artifact storage implementations you may choose when you implement this app in your own eco-system:

- Azure DevOps
- AWS CodeArtifact
- Artifactory
- Nexus
